# Project Name
### Description
This is my first FastAPI backend application. It is simple CRUD app with auth and Postgres integration.
I had a wonderful teacher on YouTube (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&list=LL&index=33&pp=gAQBiAQB)
### Features
- REST API with Oauth 2.0
- CRUD functionality for 3 db models: users, posts, votes
- SQLalchemy for reading/writing to db + alembic for db migrations
### Learnings
In this project I left the comfort of my jupyter notebook and took my Python understanding to the next level. 
I had always been curious about how APIs and software at scale actually work.
I committed myself to take courses after my day job to learn the fundamentals of practical API design.
Upon pulling back the curtain, I became obsessed with backend design and wanted to create an ambitious project of my own.
My biggest learning is to follow your curiousity, even if you don't know where it'll lead! 
It is always worth doing things for their own sake.
Not only did this tutorial lay the foundational knowledge for fantasywhales, it doubled as a useful boilerplate!
When I returned home to my jupyter notebooks, I had a newfound appreciation for programming as an art.
